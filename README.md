# Introduction to IOT and CylonJS

In this repository I'll try to create a series of examples cylon.js examples in helping new comers grasp the great cylon overlord.

All examples will be comprised of the following:

1. projectName.js
-   The javascript file that runs the code
2. projectDescription.md
-   The description of how this project works
3. projectSchematics.png
-   A fritzing image of how to wire up the hardware

For the time being I'll be starting from the basic tutorials inside the cylonJS documentation and work my way up.
I plan to start from the basic examples, like turning the LEDs on and off or using a sensor, and also up to difficult examples like raspberry pi clusters controlling different arduinos, cellular connectivities ( if possible ) and even some machine learning projects.

I'm currently taking in suggestions of projects you want documented. Just place them inside an issue so I could look at it.
